            <h3>Arepas con Perico</h3>
            <p>Even if Colombians might try to claim them for themselves, Arepas are the most basic and representative element of Venezuelan cuisine. They can be eaten with anything, at all times of the day. They can be sweet or salty, fried or grilled, eaten with various fillings or only butter if you wish to. But this time, we are going to grill them and accompany them with perico, or scrambled eggs, which is one of the most common combinations for breakfast in Venezuela.</p>

                    <p>Yield: 10 filled arepas</p>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <p>For the arepas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of pre-cooked corn flour, commonly referred to as masarepa</li>
                    <li>2 ½ cups of water</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of salt (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of cooking oil</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the perico:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 bell pepper</li>
                    <li>1 onion</li>
                    <li>1 tomato</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp of cooking oil</li>
                    <li>Salt to taste</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>First, throw in a bowl the corn flour, salt, and water to begin making the arepas. The order, whether it's flour or water first has always been debated, but I personally prefer to pour the water after. Once everything is in, start to knead the dough until you get a homogenous mixture. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions and make small balls that you will then flatten into discs of around 10 cm or 4 inches in diameter.</p>
            <p>Commonly, arepas are cooked on a budare, which is a special type of grill, but any grill or flat pan you own will do the trick. Place your arepas on the oiled grill and cook them at medium heat for 5 minutes on each side, until crispy and yellow/brown on the outside.</p>
            <p>While the arepas are cooking, we can start making the perico. Crack your eggs in a small bowl and scramble them, adding salt if you wish to. Then, thinly dice all your vegetables and stir-fry them with a bit of oil on a frying pan until the onion turns a bit brown. Add in your eggs and stir until the eggs are cooked. </p>
            <p>To serve, use a knife to cut into the side of the arepa and fill it with your perico. Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Tequeños</h3>
            <p>Tequeños have always been a staple of Venezuelan food. They can be served as breakfast or dinner and are never missing as an appetizer at family reunions or parties. They can be defined as delicious fried breaded cheese sticks, although they can be baked as well. They can be eaten as is or dipped in sauces like the traditional guasacaca (Venezuelan guacamole) or a mix of mayo and ketchup.</p>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li> 
                    <li>5 tbsp of melted butter</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>½ tsp of salt</li>
                    <li>2 ½ tsp of sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of milk powder</li>
                    <li>4 to 5 tsp of water</li>
                    <li>A 500gr block of queso de freir, or fresh white cheese</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups (or enough for frying) cups of cooking oil</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>In a bowl, mix the flour, eggs, and butter. In a different cup, pour the water and mix in the salt, sugar, and milk powder until they all dissolve in the water. Then, pour this mixture into the other bowl and knead as you go until you are left with a homogenous dough. Let sit for at least half an hour.</p>
            <p>Lightly flour a flat surface and knead for a couple of minutes until you are left with an elastic dough. Cut the dough in half and set one of the halves aside. Spread the dough into a roughly 30 x 30 cm square (12 inches), and using a knife cut the dough into 2 cm wide strips to end up with 15 strips.</p>
            <p>Cut the block of cheese into cheese sticks 6 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and 1.5 cm thick. Take a strip of dough and cover one end of a cheese stick with the dough. Wrap the dough around the stick in a spiral motion until you cover the stick entirely. Repeat until you run out of dough strips and do the same process with the leftover half of the dough.</p>
            <p>Into a pan, pour the oil and set to a high heat. Once the oil is hot, cook the tequeños in batches of 5 at a time, depending on the size of the pan, until they turn golden brown on all sides.</p>
            <p>Serve and enjoy!</p>
