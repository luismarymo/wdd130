      <p>What is Venezuelan Cuisine</p>
      <p>
        Venezuelan cuisine originated thanks to the combination of various cultures back when Venezuela first became a Spanish colony. The main groups that influenced our dishes were the Europeans and West Africans, as well as the indigenous groups that already resided in the territory that is today known as Venezuela. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These three groups of people mixed and meshed to create a very distinctive cuisine that favors strong bursts of flavor, seamlessly mixing sweet and salty. The most common ingredients used in Venezuelan dishes include corn, plantain, sugar cane, onions, tomatoes, and various other ingredients found in the region. 
      </p>
      <p>Why Should You Try It</p>
      <p>
        I might be biased, but I believe everyone should try Venezuelan food at least once in their life! It is a result of hundreds of years of different groups of people coming together to build one culture, that can cater to any palate and any preference. Plus, traditional Venezuelan recipes require ingredients that can be found in essentially every kitchen, so why not give them a shot?

      <h3>Main Dishes</h3>
      <p>Arepas con Perico</p>
      <p>
        Even if Colombians might try to claim them for themselves, Arepas are the most basic and representative element of Venezuelan cuisine. They can be eaten with anything, at all times of the day. They can be sweet or salty, fried or grilled, eaten with various fillings or only butter if you wish to. But this time, we are going to grill them and accompany them with perico, or scrambled eggs, which is one of the most common combinations for breakfast in Venezuela. 
      </p>
      <p>Yield: 10 filled arepas</p>
      <p>Prep Time: 20 minutes</p>
      <p>Ingredients</p>
      <p>For the arepas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups of pre-cooked corn flour, commonly referred to as masarepa</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups of water</li>
        <li>1 tsp of salt (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp of cooking oil</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the perico</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Preparation</p>
      <p>
        First, throw in a bowl the corn flour, salt, and water to begin making the arepas. The order, whether it’s flour or water first has always been debated, but I personally prefer to pour the water after. Once everything is in, start to knead the dough until you get a homogenous mixture. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions and make small balls that you will then flatten into discs of around 10 cm or 4 inches in diameter. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Commonly, arepas are cooked on a budare, which is a special type of grill, but any grill or flat pan you own will do the trick. Place your arepas on the oiled grill and cook them at medium heat for 5 minutes on each side, until crispy and yellow/brown on the outside. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While the arepas are cooking, we can start making the perico. Crack your eggs in a small bowl and scramble them, adding salt if you wish to. Then, thinly dice all your vegetables and stir-fry them with a bit of oil on a frying pan until the onion turns a bit brown. Add in your eggs and stir until the eggs are cooked. 
      </p>
      <p>To serve, use a knife to cut into the side of the arepa and fill it with your perico. Enjoy!</p>
      <p>Tequeños</p>
      <p>
        Tequeños have always been a staple of Venezuelan food. They can be served as breakfast or dinner and are never missing as an appetizer at family reunions or parties. They can be defined as delicious fried breaded cheese sticks, although they can be baked as well. They can be eaten as is or dipped in sauces like the traditional guasacaca (Venezuelan guacamole) or a mix of mayo and ketchup.
      </p>
      <p>Yield: 30 tequeños</p>
      <p>Prep time: 1.5 hours including resting time</p>
      <p>Ingredients</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>5 tbsp of melted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ tsp of salt</li>
        <li>2 ½ tsp of sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp of milk powder</li>
        <li>4 to 5 tsp of water</li>
        <li>A 500gr block of queso de freir, or fresh white cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups (or enough for frying) cups of cooking oil</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Preparation</p>
      <p>
        In a bowl, mix the flour, eggs, and butter. In a different cup, pour the water and mix in the salt, sugar, and milk powder until they all dissolve in the water. Then, pour this mixture into the other bowl and knead as you go until you are left with a homogenous dough. Let sit for at least half an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lightly flour a flat surface and knead for a couple of minutes until you are left with an elastic dough. Cut the dough in half and set one of the halves aside. Spread the dough into a roughly 30 x 30 cm square (12 inches), and using a knife cut the dough into 2 cm wide strips to end up with 15 strips. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cut the block of cheese into cheese sticks 6 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and 1.5 cm thick. Take a strip of dough and cover one end of a cheese stick with the dough. Wrap the dough around the stick in a spiral motion until you cover the stick entirely. Repeat until you run out of dough strips and do the same process with the leftover half of the dough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Into a pan, pour the oil and set to a high heat. Once the oil is hot, cook the tequeños in batches of 5 at a time, depending on the size of the pan, until they turn golden brown on all sides.
      </p>
      <p>Serve and enjoy!</p>

      <h3>Side Dishes</h3>
      <p>Tostones</p>
      <p>
        Simply put, Tostones are salted plantains chips that originated in the west of Venezuela. They can be found all over the country as side dishes or appetizers, and there are even brands that sell tostones like any other chips in stores. Tostones are often used as crackers to pick up other parts of a dish, like shredded beef, cheese, and more.
      </p>
      <p>Yield: ~10 tostones (depending on the size of the plantain)</p>
      <p>Prep time: 20 minutes</p>
      <p>Ingredients</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 green or unripe plantain.</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups (or enough for frying) cups of cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves thinly diced or crushed</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Preparation</p>
      <p>
        First, add the oil to a pan and set it to a high temperature. Cut the top and bottom tips of the plantain, and then cut a slit from the top to the bottom through the skin and peel it with your hands to reveal the pulp. Unripe plantain skin is very tough to peel so you might need to help yourself with a knife. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve got only the pulp, cut it into 3 cm thick slices (or a little larger than an inch) and fry them for about two minutes on each side. Once they’re yellow, remove them from the heat (don’t turn it off yet!) and lay them on paper towels to soak up the excess oil. Using a wooden press or any flat surface, gently flatten the tostones, leaving them about a centimeter thick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mix the garlic and salt with the water in a bowl that you will then dip your tostones in to give them that salty, garlicky flavor. Flick off some of the water and place them back into the pan to fry until golden and crispy on both sides. 
      </p>
      <p>Sprinkle some salt on top and serve!</p>
      <p>Papelón con Limón</p>
      <p>
        Although technically not a dish, papelón con limón is a refreshing beverage that is the best ally against that Caribbean hot weather that Venezuela is known for. It Is made with papelón or panela, which is hardened sugar cane in the form of a block and used in many other traditional recipes.
      </p>
      <p>Yield: 6 cups</p>
      <p>Prep time: The papelón must be left overnight to soak, but the active prep time is less than 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>Ingredients</p>
      <ul>
        <li>150 grams or 5 oz. of papelón, or panela.</li>
        <li>1 ¼ of fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 cups of water</li>
        <li>Lots of ice!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The preparation of papelón con limón varies from person to person. Some people like to shred the papelón and boil it, or even buy it already melted down, but the way that my mom taught me (the best way) consists of leaving the block of papelón soaking in the water overnight to break it down. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Pour the 6 cups of water into a jug or pitcher and drop in the papelón. Cover it with a lid and let it sit for around 8 hours, or until the papelón fully dissolves. Once it is done, filter it with a thin strainer to make sure it’s all dissolved in the water. Then, add in the lemon juice and stir. 
      </p>
      <p>Serve with lots of ice, and enjoy!</p>
