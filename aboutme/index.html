    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Luismary Mariño</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm 19 years old, I'm Venezuelan and I live in Maturín. On the picture above, I am the one with the glasses.</p>
    <p>I don't have many hobbies, however I do love reading and listening to music. Currently I've been very into Bossa Nova music.</p>
    <p>I have a part-time job as a Social Media Graphic Designer, but it is not really a job that I see myself doing in the long run, which is why I decided to instead persue a career in Software Development.</p>
    <p>I am single, and I live with both of my parents and my sister. They have all been a great support to me and my decision to enroll in BYU-Idaho. It's thanks to their constant support that I am here in this class and I don't think I could've done it without them. My sister is the one in the picture with me, she recently graduated as an Architect.</p>
    <p>I have actually taken a HTML and CSS course before, so I am a little familiar with some basic concepts. It was a couple of years ago and I never got to use those skills, so I don't really remember a lot. I did remember how to add color to the title and a border to the image, so I'm a bit proud of that!</p>
    <p>I'm not a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I am Catholic. These past months that I have been in BYU-Pathway I've met many people from the church and they have all been very wonderful and inviting. I've also gone to a couple of Sunday meetings in the church near me, it was a very nice experience.</p>
    <p>I hope to have a great semester with you all!</p>
