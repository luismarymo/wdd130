                    <h4>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).

                    <h4>Is whitewater rafting safe?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.

                    <h4>I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Of course! Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD).  Your guide will give you an in depth safety talk explaining what to do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                    <h4>What is included in the trip?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours.
